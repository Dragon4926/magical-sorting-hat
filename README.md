# Magical Sorting Hat

Welcome to the **Magical Sorting Hat** project! This fun and interactive web application randomly assigns a Hogwarts house to the user when they click on the Sorting Hat image.

## Features

- **Random House Assignment**: Click on the hat to discover your Hogwarts house.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Enjoy cool GIF animations as your house is being revealed.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **Click the Hat**: The Sorting Hat image starts an animation upon being clicked.
2. **Watch the Magic**: The hat first shows a short animation and then reveals your assigned house.
3. **House Reveal**: After a brief delay, your destined house will be displayed with a unique GIF.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the webpage (make sure you have this file).
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the house selection and animations.
- **hat.png**: The image file for the sorting hat (make sure this is in the same directory as the HTML file).

## Setup
